# Build 223

2022-04-19

## Improvements

* Apache HTTPd Tracing:
  - Added support for [custom HTTP headers capture](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=agent-host-configuration#capture-custom-http-headers).
  - Added support for stripping secret from HTTP query parameters based on the agent's [secret configuration](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=agent-host-configuration#secrets).

* Java Trace Sensor
  - Added the ability to enable trace correlation for IBM MQ tracing. Trace correlation is **not** enabled by default for IBM MQ. For more information about the configuration, see [Enabling trace correlation for IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=machine-java-configuration#enabling-trace-correlation-for-ibm-mq).

## Fixes

* Apache HTTPd Tracing: Fixed inadvertent capture of authentication tokens from HTTP headers.
* Application Perspective: Fixed missing approximate indicator on some dashboard widgets.
