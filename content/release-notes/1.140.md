## Application Perspectives

This release introduces application perspectives for our SaaS customers! We've put together a dedicated [transition page](https://docs.instana.io/how_to/transition_to_application_perspectives) to provide guidance on successfully adopting the changes and new capabilities.

Note: Some of our largest customers may experience slow queries for large time windows in the new Analyze view, but optimizations are already on the way.

 - Node.js Sensor: Allow retrieval of package.json files.
 - Python Sensor: Updates to support OpenTracing v2.0
 - Python Sensor: Django & WSGI Improvements; More Safeties, Precision & Tests
 - Python Sensor: Add setuptools check on install with clear message
 - MongoDb Sensor: Supports connecting agent over TLS/SSL to MongoDb servers.
 - GWT RPC Calls are now displayed as such
 - Status Code Canges performed by ServletFilters are now captured correctly
 - Spring Web Path templates are captured and used for endpoint mapping
 - Better hostname detection on Windows Servers
 - Improved tracing through Mule ESB
 - Etcd sensor now more reliably detecs different etc configurations

 - Improve Java 9 + 10 compatibility. Experimental Java 11 support.
 - Improved compatibility to Docker Container User Namespaces
 - Agent CPU usage reductions
 - Issue severity levels for issues reported for infrastructure entities were redefined. See full list of tuned issues [here](https://docs.instana.io/releases/notes/data_140/).
 Critical severity now means that the entity is not able to fulfill its purpose anymore or will not be able to fulfill its purpose in the nearest future. An example would be a split-brain state in the Elasticsearch cluster or a disk empty on a host.
 Warning severity means that the performance of an entity is negatively affected, e.g. increased response time or GC time below 80%.

## Fixes
 - Node.js Sensor: Only try to instrument bluebird if it is actually available.
 - Node.js Sensor: Avoid sending batch size 0 for Redis multi commands.
 - Python Sensor: Format & clean up imports via isort
 - Dropwizard Sensor: Failing health checks are now correctly discovered.
