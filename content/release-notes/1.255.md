## Features

### Multiple levels of grouping in Analyze Infrastructure

You can add up to 5 levels of grouping in the **Analyze Infrastructure** page in the Instana UI to analyze infrastructure across multiple dimensions.

### Support for the instrumentation of go-fiber in Go Tracer

Support is added for the instrumentation go-fiber in Go Tracer.

## Improvements

### Apache HTTPd tracing

Apache HTTPd tracing modules can now dynamically enable or disable tracing by detecting for configuration changes in the agent configuration file.

### IBM Db2 LUW sensor

You can now configure the default value for both the `loginTimeout` property and the `lockAndLongQueryInterval` threshold interval for the IBM Db2 LUW sensor.

### Metric threshold warning

A warning is displayed on the dashboards of Instana to notify users that some metrics are not displayed in the Instana UI because most plugins have a limit of 3000 metrics per entity.

### User lists

- Now, the general user list, which can be found by clicking **Settings > Team settings** in the Instana UI, includes the two-factor authentication status of each user. In addition, you can sort the general user list based on the columns.
- Previously, when you clicked **Settings > Authentication > Two Factor > Users** in the Instana UI, you could see the list of two-factor authentication users. Now, the list is removed because the information is included in the general user list, which can be found by clicking **Settings > Team settings**.

## Fixes

### IBM ACE sensor

Previously, users failed to query entities with Dynamic Focus Query (DFQ) for message flows. For example, when you filtered with `'entity.ace.messageFlow.name:*'`, nothing was returned even though some message flow entities exist. The issue is fixed now.

### Temporary dynamic IBM MQ queue and service mapping

For each temporary dynamic IBM MQ queue that starts with the prefix "AMQ.", a service with the same name as the queue is created automatically.
