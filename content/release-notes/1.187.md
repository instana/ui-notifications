## Features

### GitHub Action: Remote Instana Agent Update

We released a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/instana/github-action-update-agent-configurations) to remotely trigger the update of Instana agents using Git-based configuration management.
The [GitOps Demo](https://github.com/instana/gitops-demo) repository shows you examples of how to automatically trigger configuration updates of your agents using GitHub and Git hooks.

### Application Dashboards: Time Shift

Metrics can be easily compared to past timeframes in application, service and endpoint dashboards using [Time Shift](https://www.instana.com/docs/application_monitoring/#time-shift).

## Improvements

* Go: as of [`v1.19.0` of `github.com/instana/go-sensor`](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/v1.19.0) an instrumented service running in AWS Fargate is now reporting the resource usage metrics for process and Docker container. The reported metrics are:
  * Containers: CPU, memory and network usage
  * Process: CPU, memory, open file limits and usage
* Go: as of [`v1.20.0` of `github.com/instana/go-sensor`](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/v1.20.0) the instrumentation of services running AWS Fargate accept configuration via [environment variables](https://www.instana.com/docs/reference/environment_variables/#serverless-monitoring). This release promotes the AWS Fargate to GA.
* Prometheus Sensor: added support for `untyped` type of metrics, improved overall performance of sensor on large responses.
* Ruby / Sidekiq: the Job name is now used for the `call.name` rather than the Queue name, which is already used for the Endpoint, and this duplication provides no value.

## Fixes

* Agent list: fixed issue where 'offline' Agents were no longer correctly included in the list

## Deprecations

* The custom payload for alert configurations via API is now flagged as deprecated, as it will soon be replaced with a much improved capability.
