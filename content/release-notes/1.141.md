## Features
 - Application Perspectives: Tag suggestions for Analyzing Calls
 - Application Perspectives: Additional tags `service.name`, `endpoint.name` and `call.technology` for creating Application Perspectives
 - Application Perspectives: Default application showing all services receiving calls
 - Application Perspectives: Handling of 'late spans' so they become visible and searchable in the calls view
 - Application Perspectives: Improved several of the default 'service rules' to create better named services
 - Custom metrics (eg. Dropwizard, JMX or StatsD) can now be used in custom rules definition
 - Python & Ruby Sensor: Support Custom Header collection.  See the [documentation](https://docs.instana.io/quick_start/agent_configuration/#capturing-custom-http-headers) for details on how to specify custom headers to be collected.
 - Java Sensor: Added Support for Async Servlet API, Scalatra, Neo4J tracing and Novell LDAP driver
 - New Hazelcast Server Sensor
 - New Neo4j Server Sensor

## Improvements
 - Python Sensor: Snapshot reporting: Better version extraction
 - Python Sensor: Better Fork detection & handling
 - Python Sensor: pkg_resources: Add discovery support and add safeties
 - Python Sensor: Better boot behavior; Respect load dynamics
 - JBoss EJB tracing will now capture exceptions
 - Apache CXF Tracing will capture WSDL urls
 - Solr Sensor: Support Solr 7.x
 - Kubernetes Sensor now has greatly reduced memory and CPU usage for large clusters. If you gave the agent more memory, you can revert that now.
 - Improved support for monitoring newer OpenJ9 JVMs
 - Custom rules can be now defined on the custom metrics, such as Dropwizard, JMX or StatsD
 - When a service or an application suffers a drop to zero in requests, a new issue with a title "Complete drop in the number of requests" and severity CRITICAL is triggered. In case there is a drop but the service is still being called, an issue "Sudden drop in requests" with severity WARNING is triggered.

## Fixes
 - Application Perspectives: application creation based on multi-value tags such as `host.tag`
 - Python Sensor: Django: Store scope on the request object
 - Ruby Sensor: Add support for common configuration (standard environment variables)
 - StatsD Sensor: Fixes problem where it could no longer update under high load
 - Solr Sensor: Fixes locale dependent parsing problems
