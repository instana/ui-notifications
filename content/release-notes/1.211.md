## Features


### Kafka Lag Data Monitoring
- Added a support to enable/disable lag data collection (it was automatically collected by default). Refer to the [Kafka documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/kafka) for more information.

## Improvements

* End User Monitoring for Websites: the Get Grouped Beacon Metrics API endpoint now supports complex filters with AND/OR operators and nested levels.
* UI Backend performance: reduced memory pressure and improved performance of simple graph related queries
* Go Sensor: version instrumentation/instaecho/v1.0.0 was released. Support for Echo framework was added.
* Application Perspective configurations: AP configurations can now be viewed in read-only mode by users that do not have permission to create applications, but have an AP assigned as a RBAC area.

## Fixes

* C++ Sensor 1.1.4: Removed false positive monitoring event `cpp_collector_not_installed`.
* PHP Tracer Extension 1.16.7:
  * Added cURL error reporting
  * Fixed crashing profiler in CLI environment
