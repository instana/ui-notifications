# Build 252

2023-06-27

## Breaking changes

### Synthetic Monitoring (Open Beta)

The `$http` API in Synthetic API script is based on the [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) module, which is deprecated now.
Since Instana release 252, a new `$got` API is introduced, and it is based on the [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) module.
The `$http` API will be reserved for some time, and your existing scripts will still work, but it will be removed in the future. You are highly recommended to migrate your API script from `$http` to `$got`.
For more information, see [API Script Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/api_script.html).

## Features

### AWS CloudFront

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors AWS CloudFront. For more information, see [AWS support](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/aws/index.html).

### Node.js

The Instana Node.js SDK now has methods to mark spans as an error. For more information, see [Node.js API](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/node-js/api.html#accessing-the-currently-active-span).

### Open Beta

#### Action Framework

Action Framework is now available as Open Beta in Instana SaaS environments. By using this feature, you can add automation directly into Instana to diagnose and remediate events.
For more information, see [Action Framework (Open Beta)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/automation/index.html).

#### Monitoring IBM PowerVC

A new sensor for monitoring IBM PowerVC is implemented as Open Beta. For more information, see [Monitoring IBM PowerVC](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/powervc/index.html).

#### Recurrent maintenance windows

Apart from one-time maintenance windows (for downtime), Instana also supports setting up recurrent maintenance windows, which can be automatically scheduled at regular intervals.
While you create the windows, you can choose from the following options: daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. For more information, see [Scheduling maintenance windows](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/events_alerts/maintenance-window.html).


#### Synthetic Monitoring: Secure credentials

Many script-based Synthetic tests require the use of credentials to run the test against an application. You are provided with new permissions to control which users can create and use credentials. For more information, see [Permissions for Synthetic Monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/synmon_permissions.html#permission-details).

New Open APIs are also available so that you can create a credential in a Synthetic test and get a list of credential names by using APIs. For more information, see the APIs in the [Synthetic settings section](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#tag/Synthetic-Settings).

For information about how to use the Synthetic credential in a script-based Synthetic test, see the [API Script guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/api_script.html#instana-api-script-reference).

**Note:** This feature will be enabled in Instana SaaS one region at a time once Instana 252 is available, beginning with the Orange region.

### WebSphere Application Server sensor

#### Add events for WAS certification expiration

In the Instana UI you can now see the remaining days before certificate expiration in the metrics that are related to WebSphere Application Server. For more information, see [Monitoring WebSphere Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/websphere-as/index.html).

#### Add JMS connection data

Added Java Message Service (JMS) connection data. For more information, see [Monitoring WebSphere Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/websphere-as/index.html).

## Improvements

### Open Beta

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Deletion confirmation dialog enhancements

The confirmation dialogs that appear when you request to delete a test or delete a location are enhanced for consistency with other parts of the Instana UI.
The dialogs allow you to enter an optional reason for the deletion and require you to enter specific confirmation text. In addition, the ability to delete a test has moved from the **Tests** tab to the **Configuration** tab of a specific Synthetic test.

For more information about deleting a test, see [Viewing the configuration for a test](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/mon_endpoints.html#viewing-the-configuration-for-a-test).

For more information about deleting a location, see the documentation of the **Locations** tab in [Using the Synthetic Monitoring user interface](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/synmon_ui.html#the-locations-tab).

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Open API documentation improvements

The following updates are made to the Synthetic Monitoring section of the Open API documentation:
- Permissions that are required for all operations are added to the documentation.
- The schemas for the payloads for PATCH and PUT operations are updated.

For more information about the Synthetic Monitoring APIs, see [Open API documentation](https://instana.github.io/openapi).

#### Synthetic PoP: Image root path is changed

The image root path of Synthetic PoP is changed from `containers.instana.io/instana/release/synthetic` to `containers.instana.io/synthetic` due to the underlying artifactory migration. You need to use the latest-published Helm chart for PoP installation or upgrading.

If you want to manually pull the images, use the new image path.

### Role-based access control improvements

- Groups:
    - Improved the Instana UI to clarify what is configured and simplify the role-based access control (RBAC) configuration.
    - Limited scope can now be set separately for Websites, Mobile apps, Applications, and Kubernetes.
    - Adding or removing users now takes affect immediately without having to save.
- Users:
    - Improved the Instana UI to clarify what a user has access to.

For more information, see [Managing user access](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/admin/manage-users.html).

## Fixes

### IBM DataPower sensor

You can now use Dynamic Focus Query (DFQ) in filters for all DataPower entities like appliance, cluster, domain, and service; for example: 'entity.ibmdatapower.domain.name:*'. For more information about using Dynamic Focus Query (DFQ), see [Filtering with dynamic focus](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/dynamic_focus/index.html).

### IBM Db2 LUW sensor

The issue that the latest full-backup information for IBM Db2 11.1.x is not retrieved and displayed on the Instana dashboard is fixed now.

### IBM MQ sensor

You can now use Dynamic Focus Query (DFQ) in filters for all MQ entities like channel, cluster, listener, mqttchannel, qm and queue; for example: 'entity.ibmmq.queue.name:*'. For more information about using Dynamic Focus Query (DFQ), see [Filtering with dynamic focus](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/dynamic_focus/index.html).

### Open Beta

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Removal of extra elements during test creation in the UI

During Synthetic test creation in the Instana UI, empty elements for headers and custom properties were added to the test definition. This issue is fixed now.

#### Synthetic PoP: Fix the issue of response size 0 in API script result

For some API script tests, the response size was showing `0` in the Synthetic test result UI. This issue is fixed now.

#### Synthetic PoP: Fix the issue of main script file path in API script bundle

Some API script bundle tests failed to run due to an issue of locating the main script file in the bundle `.zip` file. This issue is fixed now.

#### Synthetic PoP: Remove duplicated app and component label

Some Synthetic PoP pods had duplicated app and component label, which made Synthetic PoP installation failed in some Kubernetes platforms. This issue is fixed now.

### WebSphere Application Server sensor

Sometimes WebSphere application server 9 command line failed to be retrieved, so that WebSphere application server was not monitored by Instana. The issue is fixed now.
