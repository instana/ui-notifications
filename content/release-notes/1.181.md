## Features

### AWS Fargate Technical Preview

With this release we officially launch Instana’s support for [AWS Fargate on ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) as a technical preview.

AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that removes the need to provision and manage servers.
Without any code change, with Instana you can now seamlessly trace all calls in your applications running on Fargate and collect metrics for all containers in an ECS task, giving you full visibility into your Fargate resources and their performance.
Check out our [AWS Fargate documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws-fargate/) to get started.

### NGINX Tracing is Generally Available

Instana native tracing for NGINX has graduated to General Availability status.
Among other things, it greatly reduces the need of custom configuration in the `nginx.conf` file, down to the very minimum that the NGINX module system will allow us to do.
Refer to the [NGINX Tracing](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/nginx#distributed-tracing) documentation to get started.

### Cisco Webex Teams Alert Channel Integration

It is now possible to use [Cisco Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/team-collaboration.html) as an alert channel for Instana alert notifications (see [documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/webex-teams/)).

### Symfony Tracing

The PHP extension `v1.8.0` uses the route name as endpoint name to vastly improve user experience in terms of the
number of endpoints that will be created for a single route. Where we previously relied on the full URL for endpoint extraction
and hence created duplicate endpoints for a single route, we're now using the routes' name to create just one.

### Laravel Tracing

The PHP extension `v1.8.0` adds support for tracing the Laravel framework and the underpinning Blade template engine.

Much like with our enhanced support for Symfony, we're relying on the route name (if set), or the route scheme for endpoint creation.

### W3C TraceContext Support for the PHP Tracer

The PHP extension `v1.8.0` adds support for W3C Trace Context.

### 2FA User List

A full list of all users and a marker if they have 2FA activated can be found under Settings > Authentication > Users.

### Profiling Hotspots

The profiles view is now enriched with a summary page. On this page, users can find a list of all profiles which have a self time greater than 5% (at least 5 profiles are shown, even if they don't match this threshold). The profiles can be expanded to the the stack trace up to this call. This allows users to concentrate on the important profiles and easily find out, where the potential issues come from.

### Authentication

What could earlier be configured under the sub-portal _unit-company.instana.io/ump/company/unit/authentication/_ can now be configured in the product itself. A link to your page can be found in the product under _More > Management Portal_ of the main navigation. Please check out the new pages under _Settings > Authentication > Google SSO / SAML / LDAP_ (onprem only). 

### Vault Secret Manager Integration

Instana host agent can now retrieve confidential data from secret managers such as credentials, that you do not want to put in clear text in the `configuration.yaml` file. For more information, see the [Instana docs](/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#integration-with-secret-managers).

## Improvements

* Service dependency graph on AP dashboard will be shown in left to right flow layout by default.
* The Go sensor as of `v1.13.2` supports activation of AutoProfile™ via an env variable (see [documentation](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor#activation-without-code-changes)).
* Kafka Connect: Connector list moved to Cluster level.
* Kafka Cluster: Exposed built-in metrics for API usage. Exposed dynamic built-in metrics for custom events.
* CPU / Memory and Wait Time profile views now come with a settings button to allow configuring a threshold to filter unimportant profiles. It is set to a default of 1%.
* Profiles are now enriched with the context guide to allow a better navigation to the corresponding entities.
* On infrastructure entity dashboards (host, process, container, etc.) users can now find a button to jump to connected profiles directly if available.

## Fixes

* Source service labels were not always correctly created for Messaging type spans, resulting in "empty" labels.
* Monitoring Issue events were sometimes not correctly shown on Host and Agent dashboards, this is now resolved.
