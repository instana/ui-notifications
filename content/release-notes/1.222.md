# Build 222

2022-04-05

## Features

### Infrastructure Counts

Instana now supports showing how many instances of a technology are reporting to Instana over time. It's available in the **Custom Dashboards** with the `Infrastructure & Platforms` data source. In the metric selector, select `Count of the number of reporting` of that type in each technology group.

## Improvements

* Node.js Tracer:
  - Released `@instana/collector@2.0.0`, `@instana/aws-lambda@2.0.0`, `@instana/aws-fargate@2.0.0`, `@instana/google-cloud-run@2.0.0`. For the previous major version 1.x only **high** severity security and bug fixes are released. It is recommended to switch to the current major version as soon as possible. Find the list of breaking changes [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-nodejs#breaking-changes). Node v6 and v8 support has been dropped in 2.0.0.
  - Added new instrumentation for [@grpc/grpc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/grpc-js) library.

* Alicloud Sensor
  - Added metrics and the build-in event for Cloud Object Storage service.
  - Added build-in event for Apsara RDS MySQL service.

* IBM i OS Sensor:
  - Added new metrics `Spinning Disk Info` to show top 20 disk information from the system. Based on the OS version and Level, either basic or advanced information will be shown.

* Endpoints that are created from HTTP paths that start with an API version will no longer be merged into a single endpoint. The endpoint names will be derived from the next path segment. See the following example:
  - `/api/v1/foo/bar` 
     The new endpoint name is `/api/v1/foo`. The previous endpoint name is `/api`.
  - `/v1/foo/bar`
     The new endpoint name `/v1/foo`. The previous endpoint name is `/v1`.
     
* Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI):
  - Added support for TKGI 1.9 to 1.13 and TAS 2.12.
  - Added agent updates and bug fixes.
  - Released Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu tile version 1.222.0.

* Improved the granularity of spark charts.
     
* Go Tracer: Instrumentation of `go-redis`.
  
* Microsoft SQL Server Sensor:
  - Introduced a configuration option to monitor MS SQL listening on a custom port, other than the default port 1433.

* Apache HTTPd Tracing:
  - Added support for [custom HTTP headers capture](../../setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/index.md#capture-custom-http-headers).
  - Added support for stripping secret from HTTP query parameters based on the agent's [secret configuration](../../setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/index.md#secrets).

## Fixes

* Fixed rendering of lone data points in the Latency and some other charts.
* Apache HTTPd Tracing: Fixed inadvertent capture of authentication tokens from HTTP headers.
