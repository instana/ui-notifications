# Build 239

2022-12-13

## Features

### Amazon MQ
- The support for RabbitMQ engine is added.
- The maximum number of monitored queues and topics is increased from 100 to 165 for AmazonMQ engine.

### IBM ACE Sensor
The support for high availability system with multi-instance/RDQM monitoring is added.

### AWS Lambda ES Modules support
The support for ES Modules is added in the layer version 223. A new handler `instana-aws-lambda-auto-wrap-esm.handler` is now available.
Furthermore, the NPM package [instana-aws-lambda-auto-wrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/instana-aws-lambda-auto-wrap) is deprecated now.

### Apache HTTPd Tracing for Windows
Instana supports tracing Apache HTTPd on Windows now.

### Log Analytics
Log lists now support infinite scrolling. Logs will be loaded automatically after the end of the page is reached.

### ServiceNow Alerting Channel
A new alerting channel is added, which allows you to automatically create incidents in ServiceNow from Instana.

### Open Beta: Adaptive Thresholds in AP Smart Alerts
Smart Alerts for Application Perspectives is extended to support _adaptive thresholds_. In contrast to _static thresholds_, _adaptive thresholds_ are thresholds that automatically adapt to seasonal changes of the underlying metrics that are observed by Instana.

### Open Beta: Analyze Infrastructure
Analyze Infrastructure provides an infrastructure-centric ad-hoc exploration solution that lets you perform multivariate comparison of infrastructure entities in a concise table across various customizable key metrics.

### PowerHMC: Adding support for Power9
The support for Power 9 and Denali P10 (FSP-based) systems is added.

### IBM DataPower Tracing
Instana now supports tracing of IBM DataPower API Gateway in API Connect cluster.

### OpenStack: Add new metrics for instances and hypervisors
- New metrics for instances and hypervisors are added.
- Flavor and image details for each OpenStack region are added.

### RabbitMQ
The support for RabbitMQ 3.10.x and 3.11.x is added.

### IBM MQ Sensor
The support for fully auto-discovery with local binding is added. IBM MQ sensor discovers all the running local queue managers in the same virtual machine. After that, the local binding connection mode is used to retrieve data directly from the shared memory of queue manager. By using this implementation, IBM MQ sensor is able to retrieve more local data compared with the previously used client mode connection.

### IBM MQ Tracing
- The support for Windows x86_64 is added.
- From IBM MQ Operator 2.2.0 (CD), IBM Instana MQ tracing is supported natively. Support is available in the IBM MQ queue manager container image 9.3.1.0-r2 (CD). To enable IBM Instana tracing, see [Integrating with IBM Instana](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/9.3?topic=operator-integrating-instana).

### Closed Beta

#### Synthetic monitoring: Create an API Script test by using Instana UI
By using the **create a test** flow in the Synthetic Monitoring UI page, you can create an API Script synthetic test. Choose the **API Script test** type, and upload the script. The format of the script will be checked. Select the locations where the test will run, and complete the rest of the steps to create the test.
If you want to upload a different file during the creation process, you need to cancel the file upload or go back to the previous step in the flow to re-enable the script input box.

#### Synthetic monitoring: Add API for compressed test result details
The existing API `/api/synthetics/results/{testid}/{testresultid}/detail?type=xxx` no longer supports retrieval of compressed format files such as videos and screenshots. This API supports only retrieval of text format files. A new API `/api/synthetics/results/{testid}/{testresultid}/file?type=<xxx>` is introduced to downloading any type of file in the format as uploaded by the Synthetic Point of Presence(PoP). You can use the new API to retrieve compressed files such as video and screenshot.

### ACE Tracing
The ACE Tracing support for Windows is added.

## Improvements

### Add a GetContainerInfo button for Containerd sensor
A **GetContainerInfo** button is added to the **containerd** dashboard to get the information of a specific container.

### Log Analytics
- The display of loading skeletons is improved.
- Custom tags with grouping and labels are improved.

### Custom Events
You can configure custom events by using multiple infrastructure metrics.

### Access Control
- Added the group count of every user into the users list.
- Added the logout functionality to the _Access Denied_ error page.

## Fixes

### User invites
- Fixed accepting a second invite for newly invited users into more than one environment.

### ACE Tracing
{: #ace-tracing-1}

- The OpenSSL version is upgraded to 1.1.1s in the trace library.
- The support for W3C trace context is added.

### Service mapping
{: #service-mapping}

A service mapping rule based on the OpenTelemetry span attribute `peer.service` is added.

### Closed Beta

#### Synthetic monitoring: Add the search capability on Instana UI
In the **Locations** tab and on the _Synthetic Test Results_ page, you can search for entries by using the **location** label.

#### Synthetic monitoring: Improve sort on Instana UI
In the **Synthetic Tests** tab, **Locations** tab and on the _Synthetic Test Results_ page, locations and tests without test result data are moved to the end of the display list.

#### Synthetic monitoring: Change URL for the test result details page
The URL for the _Synthetic Test Result details_ page is renamed to clarify that the page is part of Synthetic Monitoring.

### Log Analytics
- The problem that the log list is stuck in loading state in certain cases is fixed.
- The problem that log tags are not grouped in trace logs is fixed.
- The problem that the drop-down menu is missing when you do quick filtering and grouping by using custom parameters is fixed.

### IBM MQ Tracing
The span correlation problem with the ACE OpenTelemetry trace is fixed.

### IBM MQ Sensor
The parsing problem of the `mqs.ini` file when MQ tracing is enabled is fixed.
