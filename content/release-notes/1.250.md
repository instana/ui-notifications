### Trace details

Previously, website and mobile beacons weren't displayed in the Details panel of the Trace view on the Analytics dashboard. This issue is fixed now.

### Unbounded analytics

Previously, the sidebar search filters were not appearing in the API query menu in the Query Builder on the Analytics dashboard. This issue is fixed now.

### Open Beta

#### Synthetic monitoring: API details

Previously, when you queried Synthetic test results by using the `api/synthetic/results` Open API and used the metrics with aggregated values in the "order by" part of the API call, the call failed, and no results were returned. This issue is fixed now.
