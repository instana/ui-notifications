# Build 254

2023-07-25

## Features

### Action History

In the Instana UI, you can view the details of action runs. For more information, see [Action History](../../automation/action-history.md).

### Apdex widget

The **Apdex** widget is now generally available in your custom dashboards.

### Business monitoring

Instana supports business process monitoring to provide real-time business context for IT. Business monitoring extends observability to business processes.

**Business Monitoring** is added as a menu item in the Instana UI. You can view a high-level summary of all of your connected business processes in **Business Monitoring**. 

### Custom events

A system rule is added to Instana to verify the number of entities that run on a host for an event. The rule named **Hosts that have unexpected number of entities running on them** is included in the **System Rule** list in **Settings** > **Events** > **New Event** > **Create a New Event**.

### IBM ACE tracing

The environment variable `REMOVE_MQ_HEADER` is added for IBM ACE tracing. Some message flows verify the message structure to ensure the accuracy of the data. However, a message flow exception might occur if an MQRFH2 header is added to an IBM MQ message when IBM ACE or IBM MQ tracing is enabled. You can use the environment variable `REMOVE_MQ_HEADER=TRUE` to delete the trace context in the MQRFH2 header so that message flows can work as expected.

### IBM DataPower sensor

Instana supports monitoring gateway peering status of DataPower. The table `Gateway Peering Status` is added to the IBM DataPower Domain dashboard in the Instana UI. The built-in event `IBM DataPower Gateway Peering status` is added and is triggered if any configuration doesn't meet the [data-synchronization and failover criteria](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/datapower-gateway/10.5.0?topic=gateway-peering#gatewaypeering__failover__title__1).

### IBM MQ Tracing

The support for message destination-based instrumentation is added. With this feature, you can selectively enable and disable IBM MQ Tracing or trace correlation information propagation in IBM MQ Tracing for a subset of message destinations (queues or topics).

### Infrastructure Resources snapshots API

The new `POST /api/infrastructure-monitoring/snapshots` endpoint can retrieve detail information for multiple snapshots. For more information, see [OpenAPI](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/postSnapshots).

### OS process sensor

The `env_vars_enabled` option is added. You can use this option to enable or disable the collection of environment variables. 

### RabbitMQ cluster monitoring

Instana now supports RabbitMQ cluster monitoring, including automatic cluster detection.

### SLO widget for websites

The **SLO** widget in your custom dashboards now supports website service level objectives.

### WebSphere Application Server sensor

In the Instana UI, You can see metrics that are related to Service Integration Bus (SIB) if you enabled related Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) counters in the WebSphere administrative console.

## Improvements

### Crio Sensor

The **Memory usage %** metric is available for custom event.

### File system metrics

File system metrics are now included in the Infrastructure metric catalog of the Analyze Infrastructure dashboard and Custom Dashboards.  
Metrics that are added include RX Bytes, TX Bytes, RX Errors, and TX Errors.

### Infrastructure correlation

Calls can be correlated to databases that run in Docker containers more reliably now.

### Logging

The default level of logs for `stdout` streams is not `INFO`, and the default level of logs for `stderr` streams is not `ERROR`. If the system cannot determine the log level based on the content and structure of the log message, the log level is categorized and displayed as `UNKNOWN`.

### RabbitMQ sensor

Instana now supports monitoring RabbitMQ 3.12.x. Also, the overall stability of the sensor is now improved.

### Synthetic monitoring

- The default resource requests and limits numbers are optimized in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/instana/synthetic-pop-charts/blob/main/values.yaml) file of Synthetic PoP helm charts based on the performance test result.
- The kafkajs module is upgraded to version 2.2.4 in JavaScript playback engine of Synthetic PoP.
- Insecure certificates are allowed for HTTPS calls by default for the `$http` API in the Instana Synthetic API script.

## Fixes

### Applications

When you removed an application that was starred, you would see an error message. This issue is fixed now.

### Email invites

- An issue with invites to already existing user accounts that join an additional tenant is now fixed.
- An issue with uppercase letters in invite emails is now fixed.

### Kubernetes

- Fixed the issue that unscheduled and unready pod counts values were missing in the charts of the Kubernetes **DaemonSet** and **StatefulSet** dashboards. These pod counts values might still be unavailable for customers who use the DaemonSet yaml installation method.
- Fixed the issue that incorrect pod counts values were displayed in the chart of the Kubernetes **Namespace** dashboard.
- Fixed the issue that duplicate events were displayed in the Kubernetes dashboards of the Instana UI.
- Fixed the issue that false alerts on the cluster node count were triggered.

### Synthetic monitoring

The following Synthetic monitoring fixes are included in this release:

- If you used the `PATCH` API to modify your Synthetic test, the Synthetic server that handled the API would add an incorrect property to the test, and thus the Synthetic test could not be retrieved, updated, or deleted by using either API or the Instana UI. Now the issue is fixed.

- When you switch the method of creating a Synthetic test from using the **Create Synthetic Test** wizard to using the advanced mode, the script content was not carried over into the **Configuration** section of the advanced mode. This issue is fixed.
- When you create an API Script test in the Synthetic monitoring UI, if the script content is pasted into the input box and saved, nothing was displayed in the **Configuration** section. This issue is fixed.
- In the Synthetic monitoring UI, when you edited a Synthetic test that was paused, the test became active when changes were saved. This issue is fixed. The test remains in the paused state when changes are saved.
- When an expectJSON was added to a Synthetic test definition, a JSON snippet couldn't be added. This issue is fixed.
- Previously, when an API script ended with a comment line, the API script failed to run in Synthetic PoP. This issue is fixed now.
- Previously, when an API script test was created with a timeout greater than 1 minute, the timeout was ineffective in the test run. This issue is fixed now.

### Unbounded Analytics

A issue of calls analytics when calls are grouped by log messages and filtered by HTTP headers at the same time is fixed.
