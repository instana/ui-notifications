# Build 242

2023-02-07

## Features

### AWS API Gateway

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors AWS API Gateway. For more information, see [AWS support](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-monitoring-amazon-web-services-aws).

### Analyze Infrastructure API

Analyze Infrastructure is now supported on the API.
The API features an endpoint for [fetching entities along with metrics](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getEntities) and [an endpoint for fetching entities grouped on a tag with aggregated metrics](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getEntityGroups).
There are also endpoints to retrieve [entity types](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getAvailablePlugins) and [metric names](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getAvailableMetrics).

### Synthetic Monitoring
Synthetic Monitoring is now supported.
Synthetic Monitoring allows you to perform proactive monitoring of your websites and applications.  For more information see [Synthetic Monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=synthetic-monitoring-open-beta).

## Improvements

### Infrastructure Tag Catalog

The tag catalog used for filtering and grouping in the Analyze Infrastructure and Infrastructure Custom Dashboards is improved by removing irrelevant tags that won't return results. Only monitored tags in the environment are shown in the tag catalog. Furthermore, keys for key value type tags are promoted in the tag catalog, enabling easier search and discovery of user-provided tags.

## Fixes

### Custom dashboards: Fix permissions for personal API tokens

Previously, when a user access is granted to a custom dashboard, the personal API tokens don't have implicit access.
The users' access is only usable on Instana UI, instead of the API.
If the custom dashboard contains an invalid definition, the user is unable to view, edit or delete this custom dashboard.

Now the personal API tokens are implicitly granted the same permission as the user that it relates to.  
When you create or edit a custom dashboard, explicit access can be granted to adjust a personal API tokens access so that the personal API tokens have different permissions as the user that they relate to.

### The Export to CSV function in Analyze Infrastructure

The **Export to CSV** function in the _Analyze Infrastructure_ dashboard is updated to correct the export of percentage metric values. The exported metric values in percentage respect the same rounding (rounded to the nearest integer or to two decimal places) as on Instana UI.

###  DB2: Days since last full database backup

Previously, even when an incremental backup was taken, it was interpreted as a full database backup.
This lead to alerts not being displayed or false alerts being displayed, and users raise issues for these wrong behaviours.

Now the problem is solved by picking the differences in days since the last full backup was completed.
