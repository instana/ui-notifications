## Features

Strap your seatbelts on, this release is _wild_!

### Unbounded Analytics enhancements (Closed Beta)

Unbounded Analytics for calls and traces has been completely redesigned with more capabilities. You will be able to create much more
sophisticated filters using brackets and an `OR` operator in addition to previously supported `AND` operator. You will be able to quickly
peek into groups to see their calls or traces. For more information watch this preview video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP1ybt80JTk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP1ybt80JTk).

Please, let us know if you would like to sign up for the closed beta program.

### AWS Lambda Support for Java (Technology Preview)

In addition to the existing Node.js and Python support, Instana now offers AutoTrace support for [AWS Lambda functions built in Java](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws-lambda/java/).
The work to set up Instana tracing is minimal and in line with the Node.js and Python Lambda experience: include adding our AWS Lambda Layer and specifying three environment variables.
The AWS Lambda Java runtimes `java8.a12` and `java11` are supported.
Head to our [AWS Lambda documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws-lambda/) for full information.

### AWS Lambda Support for Go

With the new [`v1.23.0`](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/v1.23.0) of `github.com/instana/go-sensor` you can trace AWS Lambda functions written in Go with Instana.
The new [`github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentaion/instalambda`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentation/instalambda) instrumentation package provides wrappers to instrument AWS Lambda handlers with Instana.
For more details, refer to the [instrumentation README](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/tree/master/instrumentation/instalambda/) and [Instana AWS Lambda Go](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws-lambda/go) documentation pages.

### PHP 8 Support

The Instana trace extension version beginning v1.13.0 ships support for the PHP 8 runtime environment.
To put it in context, we support PHP 8 from day 1 and, as always, the PHP extension will be automatically delivered over your Instana agents with automatic updates and automatically installed in your shiny PHP 8 runtimes.

### Agent: Configuration From Process Environment & Files

The host agent is capable to read configuration _values_ in configuration.yaml from process specific environment variables and files. This way multiple instances of the same technology (e.g. multiple MySQL database instances) with different credentials can be configured. Reading configuration values from files alignes with th way kubernetes mounts secrets into containers. For more details refere to the [host agent configuration instructions](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#configurations-from-process-environment--files).

### API Token Management On Unit-Level

Many of our customers have what we call multiple Instana units like prod-example.instana.io and qa-example.instana.io (belonging to tenant example). As part of our investment to improve Instana's access control mechanisms, we are today changing how [Instana's Web REST API tokens work](https://www.instana.com/docs/api/web).

Previously, a single Web REST API token granted access to all Instana units belonging to the same tenant. This behavior created access-control challenges. For example, when one wanted to open up a development unit's access control to a broader audience. With this release, you can manage Web REST API tokens for each unit. A Web REST API token created for qa-example will not grant access to prod-example and vice versa.

Web REST API tokens existing at the time of the migration were duplicated for each tenant unit. This duplication means that existing Web REST API tokens will continue just as they did before.

### Instana Cloud Native Buildpack for Google Cloud Run

We released the [Instana Buildpack for Google Cloud Run](https://github.com/instana/instana-buildpacks/tree/main/google-cloud-platform/cloud-run), a shiny [Cloud Native Buildpack](https://buildpacks.io/) to be used together with the [Google Cloud Buildpacks builder](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/buildpacks) to create Google Cloud Run images that already contains everything you need to monitor applications running on managed Google Cloud Run written in:

* Java
* Node.js
* .NET Core

When you use the Instana Buildpack for Google Cloud Run together with the `pack` utility, all you need to do to is to add the `INSTANA_ENDPOINT_URL` and `INSTANA_AGENT_KEY` environment variables to your service revision and you are good to go ;-)

As always, you will find the instructions to use this new way of instrumenting your Cloud Run applications in the "Installing Instana Agents" dialog.

### Instana Pipeline Feedback Orb for CircleCI

The [Instana Pipeline Feedback orb](https://github.com/instana/pipeline-feedback-orb) allows you to create new releases and track the latest release from the comfort of your [CircleCI](https://circleci.com//) workflows.

### vSphere vMotion events

Instana agent collects various vMotion event types and reports them as Instana events.
For more details, refer to the [vMotion events collection](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/vsphere/#vmotion-events-collection).

### Custom Payload in Alerts

The payload of alerts can now be customized. This allows to either include relevant information of your monitored system as part of your alert notification, or to enable advanced alert routing use-cases using your alert management tool of choice. for further details, please check out the [Configure Custom Payload in Alerts](https://www.instana.com/docs/events_alerts/custom-payload) docs.

### Solace JMS support for the Java Trace Sensor

As of version `1.2.356` the [Java Trace Sensor](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/jvm#tracing) officially supports tracing JMS messages with the [Solace](https://solace.com/) JMS client version `10.x`.

### Authentication support for Git-based Configuration Management

The [Git-based Configuration Management](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/git_ops) now supports authentication at remote repositories through environment variables.
This feature is especially handy to access repositories hosted by one of the main git-hosting providers using private token. How to set up such an integration is described in [this easy example](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/git_ops#example).

### DBmarlin integration

Instana now integrates with [DBmarlin](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/dbmarlin). Several Instana database dashboards include a link towards DBmarlin in case you want a deeper insight of your database and application performance.

### Other Features

* Custom dashboards can now be created via our [Web REST API](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#tag/Custom-Dashboards).
* Custom dashboards' configuration can now be inspected as JSON directly from within our user interface even without write access.
* Account & Billing tab is now only visible to users with enabled `Access to account and billing information` permission.
* Instana agent Helm chart:
  * Allow using user-specified memory measurement units in `agent.pod.requests.memory` and `agent.pod.limits.memory`. If the value set is numerical, the Chart will assume it to be expressed in Mi for backwards compatibility.
  * Exposed `agent.updateStrategy.type` and `agent.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` settings.

## Improvements

* Stored dashboard links maintain selection of tabs and metric aggregations.
* The TV mode of custom dashboards now persists across page refreshes.
* The Node.js tracer (`@instana/collector`) now supports [automatic aggregation](https://www.instana.com/docs/tracing/analytics/#automatic-aggregation-of-short-exit-calls) of very short (< 10 ms), high frequency database calls. This helps to keep the performance overhead of tracing at a minimum in scenarios where such calls are executed in rapid succession. This capability is opt-in at the moment. It will become the default behaviour in one of the next releases. Refer to the [Node.js configuration docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/node-js/configuration#automatic-aggregation-of-short-exit-calls) to learn how to enable it right away.
* Tracing SDK: [support for GraphQL spans](https://www.instana.com/docs/tracing/custom-best-practices/#graphql).
* Our website monitoring user agent parser gets an update to support many new user agents and to improve detection for existing user agents. Notable changes:
  * Improved detection for Android 9 and Android 10.
  * Improved detection for mobile web views.
  * For Windows operating systems, we now correctly differentiate between operating system name and version.
  * New detection for less commonly used web browsers, e.g., QQ Browser Mobile, MiuiBrowser, QQ Browser Mobile and others.
* JVM: Display heap memory usage percentage at Heap Memory dashboard
* MySQL Sensor: Add support for monitoring replica metrics
* Java Trace Sensor
  * Official support for [Solace JMS](https://solace.com/)
  * Prevent instrumentation of JVMs that already use the Dynatrace agent
  * Improve Kotlin Coroutine support
* Small UI improvements in the Event Details View

## Fixes

* Fix duplicated endpoints in different cases in frameworks where the path and path template are case insensitive such as asp.net.
* Kubernetes: Sorting on *deployments*, *deploymentConfigs*, *daemonSets*, *statefulSets* and *pods* for *Namespaces*, *Clusters*, and *Cluster > Namespaces*
